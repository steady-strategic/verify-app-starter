      <p>
        Provide Real, Lasting Recovery
      </p>
      <p>
        For clinicians seeking a therapy that addresses a wide array of afflictions including chronic pain, addiction, emotional distress, depression, PTSD — MORE offers exactly that.

      <p>
        Developed by Dr. Eric Garland, a leading expert on the use of mind-body therapies, MORE brings together mindfulness, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and positive-psychology practices to restore well-being and bring back meaning and joy.
      </p>
      <p>
        MORE has been rigorously tested in over 16 clinical trials, funded by $90M from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense.
